								<h2>What we cover</h2>
								
								<ul>
									<li><p>High blood pressure is not defined by a single, universal level—furthermore, it is higher than the modern medical recommendation of a systolic pressure lower than 130 and a diastolic pressure lower than 80. A more scientifically supported systolic number for hypertension is calculated based on age and sex with a formula for adult men and women:</p>
									<p><i>For men: 110 + (2/3)*(age)
									<br>For women: 104 + (5/6)*(age)</i></p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>Hypertension, although commonly seen as a disease to be treated, should rather be seen as a <em>symptom</em> of an underlying condition.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>Blood pressure medications carry numerous risks and side effects. Researchers have suggested that a substantial portion of the population that falls within the <em>recently lowered</em> blood pressure guideline range may not actually benefit from medication, putting them at greater risk than prior to treatment.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>Natural treatments are safer and more effective. Beyond exercise, losing excess body fat, and eating well, there is <em>potassium</em>: a mineral we already consume. An increase in potassium intake has been shown to significantly lower blood pressure levels in multiple studies among other health benefits.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>The purported effect of salt on blood pressure is overstated. Comprehensive research on salt restriction has shown that there is insufficient data to recommend it as a treatment for hypertension. Sodium, an essential mineral, poses health risks when limited to such amounts as low as 1,500 mg per day as recommended by the American Heart Association (AHA). The human body naturally craves salt when there is a deficiency; it is important to listen to what the body is saying rather than ignoring biological functions.</p>

								<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
								<p><em>High blood pressure</em>, also known as <em>hypertension</em>, is a condition defined by the force of blood pushing against the walls of blood vessels being "too high." A blood pressure "reading" consists of two forces: <em>systolic pressure</em>, which occurs when blood is pumped out of the heart and into arteries, and <em>diastolic pressure</em>, which occurs when the heart is resting between beats. Both pressures are measured in mm Hg (millimeter of mercury). Blood pressure readings are formatted with the systolic number first and the diastolic number second, usually separated by a slash (/): for instance, 130/80 represents a systolic pressure of 130 mm Hg and a diastolic pressure of 80 mm Hg. High blood pressure has been associated with conditions such as heart attack and stroke.</p>
								<p>In recent years, there have been ongoing changes and debates in the medical community regarding what constitutes hypertension. Current American Heart Association standards classify prehypertension as a systolic range of 120-129 and a diastolic range of less than 80. It is important for this information to be accurate for the average person, as these guidelines help determine whether medication, such as beta blockers, diuretics, and ACE inhibitors, is considered for treating high blood pressure. Concerningly, there is evidence to suggest that drug companies have been deliberately influencing lower blood pressure guidelines to increase drug sales.</p>
								<p>This article will use evidence from scientific resources to show what really constitutes a healthy blood pressure level, the risks of medication, the causes of high blood pressure, and certain natural treatments that may be even more effective than commonly prescribed drugs. Additionally, it will debunk common myths about blood pressure and reveal the overlooked science behind this topic.</p>

									<h2 id="lowering-standards">Lowering Standards, Raising Profits</h2>
									<h3 id="header-sect-subtext">What is really a healthy blood pressure?</h3>
									</div>

								<p>The official guideline range of hypertension has a history of change. More specifically, what constitutes high blood pressure has been steadily lowering over the years: what was initially classified as stage 1 hypertension, 160/90, has now dropped to 130/80-89. Despite a multitude of research suggesting that the latter range is closer to normal than to “high", the World Health Organization (WHO) and the federal National Institutes of Health have both been calling for a further reduction of the guideline numbers, raising questions regarding their motivation. There is evidence to suggest that these decisions may be financially motivated by drug companies. As stated in a 2005 article from <i>The Seattle Times</i>, "In May 2003, for example, an NIH panel recommended broader use of hypertension drugs at lower blood pressures. Nine of the 11 authors of the guidelines had ties to the drug companies."<sup><a href="#citations">[1]</a></sup></p>
								<p>To determine if the current blood pressure guidelines are more optimal than former guidelines, it is useful to look at where the numbers originated from. The Framingham Heart Study is a famous study that analyzes various patterns in families, primarily in relation to cardiovascular health. The study began in 1948, recently passing its 75th year of continuous, multi-generational research, examining over 4,000 participants to determine risk factors for cardiovascular disease and, relevantly, its correlation with blood pressure.</p>
									
								<p>In January of 2000, there was a reevaluation of the data from the Framingham Heart study published in <i>The Lancet</i> which concluded that the medical consensus for the systolic cut-off value for high blood pressure, 140 mm Hg (now 130 mm Hg), was <em>contradictory to the data of the popular study that founded the cut-off value itself</em>. Furthermore, the study states that “...there is an age-dependent and sex-dependent threshold for hypertension. <strong>A substantial proportion of the population who would currently be thought to be at increased risk are, therefore, at no increased risk.</strong>"<sup><a href="#1">[2,3]</a></sup></p>
								<p></p>

								<p>For context, 140 mm Hg systolic pressure is now the current cut-off value for stage 2 hypertension according to the American Heart Association (AHA). Not only does the reevaluation discredit these guidelines, it also shows that the study data disproves the positive linear correlation between systolic blood pressure and mortality rates. The age and sex-dependent threshold for treating hypertension is calculated for ages up to 74 by using the formula provided in the reevaluation:</p>
								<p><i>For men: 110 + (2/3)(age)<br>For women: 104 + (5/6)(age)</i></p>
								<p>	For instance, this would mean that for a 55-year-old man, the systolic cut-off value for hypertension is 146-147 mm Hg. This data suggests that a healthy blood pressure is not a single, universal level, and that older guidelines were likely more accurate to the human body before the recent reductions of these numbers. Moreover, instead of a linear correlation between higher systolic pressure and higher mortality as it is currently assumed when establishing these guidelines, it is more accurate to say that there is a sharp increase in mortality rates upon reaching significantly higher blood pressure levels, as illustrated in the graph below:</p>

								<div class="table-image">
									<img src="image-source2.png" alt="Age-adjusted mortality rates for men aged 45-74 years relating to systolic blood pressure.">
									<div class="link-container">

													<sup>https://www.math.ucla.edu/~scp/publications/mortality.PDF</sup>
											</a>
											<a href="#1"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
									</div>
							</div>

								<p>It is now established that healthy blood pressure levels can vary according to age and sex, in addition to numerous other variables. It was also shown that after a narrow range, between a systolic pressure of 170 to 180, only then do mortality rates begin to rise significantly. Another analysis of evidence from the Framingham Heart Study published in <i>Open Heart</i> further supports this.<sup><a href="#3">[4]</a></sup></p>

								<p>The linear model, commonly used to estimate the risks of high blood pressure, is now shown to overestimate the risk based on the revised data. Furthermore, this overestimation can put a significant portion of the population at risk who may not need or benefit from the treatment they are recommended.<sup><a href="#1">[2,3]</a></sup> When using this data from clinical trials, as opposed to the linear model assumed by medical consensus, one may see a significant benefit in reducing systolic pressure from 190 to 160, whereas there would be little benefit in reducing it from 150 to 120. As stated in the reevaluation: "...no randomized trial has ever demonstrated any reduction of the risk of either overall or cardiovascular death by reducing systolic blood pressure from our thresholds to below 140 mm Hg."<sup><a href="#2">[3]</a></sup></p>

								<p>Data from the CDC also supports the view that the risks of high blood pressure overstated: “...although about 67% of people over 70 are hypertensive, about 0.04% between 65 and 74, 0.1% between 75 and 84, and 0.39% over 85 die each year due to their high blood pressure (including hypertensive heart disease)."<sup><a href="#3">[4]</a></sup> The flu is more deadly than high blood pressure.</p>

								<p>For those with acute heart failure, there is an in-hospital study conducted in 2006 with over 48,600 patients which found that at lower systolic pressures there was actually a <em>rise</em> in mortality rates. At higher systolic pressures, there was a <em>decrease</em> in mortality rates.</p>

									</div>
						  	</div>

								<p>It is not just acute heart failure patients, either: another large study published in the Oxford journal <i>Age and Ageing</i> examines geriatric patients, similarly displaying a decrease in mortality risk with “higher-than-normal" blood pressures.<sup><a href="#5">[6]</a></sup> Below is a table of the data from the study:</p>

								<div class="table-image" id="wide-table">
									<img src="image-source6.png" alt="Rates relating systolic and diastolic blood pressures and mortality rates in geriatric patients">

									</div>
							 </div>

								<p>Using what has been gathered from previous evidence of the Framingham study, taking the median age of 82, and considering that the subjects were mostly female, a rough average for the high systolic pressure cut-off value can be calculated:</p>

								<b><p>104 + (5/6)(82) = 172.3 mm Hg</p></b>

								<p>You may find it interesting that it falls right within the range of lowest mortality overall—anything significantly below that appears to increase risk of death considerably, and anything above 180 mm Hg also has a moderately large rise in deaths.</p>
									
								<p>We can now conclude that 140/90 (i.e., stage 2 hypertension according to the AHA) is not a universal guideline to determine high blood pressure, contrary to common belief. Moreover, it was stated in the study that some of the subjects were using medication to lower blood pressure, the most prominent being ACE inhibitors. If these medications are as effective as they are marketed to be, and assuming that lower blood pressure <em>is</em> actually healthier, why would there be so many deaths found in that group of people?</p>

								<div id="header-sect">
								<h2 id="high-hopes">High Hopes, Higher Risks</h2>
								<h3 id="header-sect-subtext">The risks of antihypertensive medication</h3>
							  </div>

								<p>A study published in 2020 aimed to evaluate if geriatric patients in the 70s-80s age range benefited from having their blood pressure artificially lowered below 140/90 via medication. Given previous results, it should be unsurprising that the non-normalized blood pressure group in their 80s had a significantly lower risk of all-cause mortality. Interestingly, the patients aged 70-79 years did not have a notable difference in risk with or without artificially lowered blood pressure. However, in both the 70s and 80s age ranges, the group with “previous cardiovascular events" did have a substantial increase in mortality with artificially lowered blood pressures—about a 55% higher risk per year.<sup><a href="#6">[7]</a></sup></p>

								<p>Additionally, a 2015 publication in <i>Science Daily</i> regarding a study performed by the University of Alabama Birmingham highlights relevant data found in the study: “Compared to people with systolic blood pressure below 120 mm Hg without treatment, hypertensive individuals on three or more blood pressure medications had a stroke risk of 2.5 times higher"<sup><a href="#7">[8]</a></sup>. The article also provides great advice to reduce body fat and increase physical activity to lower blood pressure; however, its recommendation to reduce salt intake is both ineffective and potentially harmful, a subject that is discussed in-depth later in this article.</p>

								<p>Some studies have found an increased risk of lung cancer with high dose usage of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, a common hypertension medication. For instance, a Danish study published in <i>Journal of the American Heart Association</i> found that there was a moderately increased lung cancer risk for high overall doses of ACE inhibitors.<sup><a href="#8">[9]</a></sup> A meta-analysis of 2400 records screened in 2022 also showed that there was a strong link between ACE inhibitors and lung cancer.<sup><a href="#9">[10]</a></sup></p>

								<p>Beta blockers are another less common type of medication for high blood pressure. They block the effects of adrenaline on the body, causing the heart to beat slower and with less force, overall lowering blood pressure. A 21-year study with 37,581 obstructive sleep apnea patients concluded that for those who used beta blockers, CVD (cardiovascular disease) outcomes <em>increased</em> by 3.5%, and all-cause mortality by 0.9%, compared to those who did not use them.<sup><a href="#10">[11]</a></sup></p>

								<p>Some may wonder whether certain blood pressure medications are more dangerous than others. The ALLHAT study is a major clinical trial that investigated the effectiveness of different medications for treating high blood pressure and their effect on cardiovascular health. The study compared angiotension-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and a thiazide-type diuretic ("water pill"), and stated that "...all-cause mortality did not differ between groups."<sup><a href="#12">[13]</a></sup> It is likely that while some blood pressure medications provide stronger benefits, they all have approximately the same risks.</p>

								<p>People with high blood pressure should not be relying solely upon blood pressure medication—in fact, taking into consideration the research discussed in this article, it would not be a stretch to claim that <i>at least</i> the majority of those with hypertension should avoid blood pressure medication altogether.</p>

								<p>Doctors often treat high blood pressure as a disease to be cured with medication, despite research suggesting that blood pressure medications often have side effects potentially more harmful than high blood pressure itself. However, the root of the problem is not the high blood pressure, but rather other underlying issues that present the high blood pressure as a <em>symptom</em> of a disease, and not the disease itself.</p>

								<div id="header-sect">
									<h2 id="dont-shoot">Don't Shoot the Messenger</h2>
									<h3 id="header-sect-subtext">High blood pressure is not the problem</h3>
									</div>

								<p>It is well-established in the medical community that diseases like atherosclerosis are associated with high blood pressure. For context, atherosclerosis is the buildup of plaque in the arteries that causes the arteries to narrow or clog. Many scientific journals cite high blood pressure as a direct cause of atherosclerosis, but this view fails to hold up to scrutiny.</p>

								<p>High blood pressure is simply the heart beating harder, causing the arteries to undergo a greater amount of stress. Limbs require a certain amount of designated blood flow to keep them functioning. If the arteries were narrowed—perhaps due to arterial plaque caused by a separate disease—the heart would be required to pump harder and/or faster to provide the same amount of blood to keep the limbs alive and moving. It lacks sense that the heart pumping harder would cause arterial plaque; conversely, it appears logical that arterial plaque would cause the heart to pump harder. This flawed correlation is why hypertension is frequently considered a cause of CVD, despite logic suggesting otherwise.</p>

								<p>It may be stated that when hypertensive medication is used successfully, it can lower rates of mortality and CVD; many trials have been published to demonstrate this. However, these trials largely ignore that many of these medications have direct cardiovascular benefits that may treat the diseases which coexist with high blood pressure. It doesn’t necessarily have to affect the blood pressure directly, but merely treat the cardiovascular diseases it is associated with, subsequently lowering blood pressure.</p>
									
								<p>The publication referenced earlier which reevaluated the Framingham Heart Study came to the same conclusion: “It is widely believed that randomized trials have proved that lowering blood pressure is beneficial. However, that is not true. All antihypertensive drugs have profound effects on the cardiovascular system, aside from their hemodynamic (blood flow-altering) effect. How much, if any, of the observed risk relationship can be ascribed to the reduction in pressure and how much to the direct action of the drug on the cardiovascular system? Motivated by the belief in the linear relationship of risk to pressure, many automatically attribute the risk reduction to the pressure reduction, ignoring the direct action of the drugs on the target outcomes. Results from a multitude of clinical trials make it clear that such a simplistic view cannot be true. In fact, evidence is mounting (especially from more recent trials) that it is the direct effects that are producing most, if not all, of the benefit and that the accompanying blood pressure reduction may be just an inconsequential side effect."<sup><a href="#2">[3]</a></sup></p>

								<p>A paper published in <i>Journal of the American Heart Association</i> in 2003 also came to an interesting conclusion regarding the ALLHAT study: “benefits beyond BP reduction had been attributed to some anti-hypertensive drug classes, ie, improved survival and reduced morbidity in persons with heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors8 –10 and improved insulin sensitivity and lipid profiles with a-blocker treatment."<sup><a href="#11">[12]</a></sup> To put it simply, the authors noted that the medications used in the ALLHAT study did significantly more than just lowering blood pressure.

								<p>If high blood pressure is not the cause of these diseases, could it instead be a <i>symptom</i> of these diseases? To determine this, we must examine the potential causes of high blood pressure.</p>

								<div id="header-sect">
									<h2 id="pressure-cooker">The Pressure Cooker</h2>
									<h3 id="header-sect-subtext">What causes high blood pressure?</h3>
									</div>

								<p>One of the most common causes of hypertension, both short-term and long-term, is stress. Stress and powerful negative emotions have been consistently linked to higher blood pressures.<sup><a href="#13">[14]</a></sup> Human bodies are biologically designed to induce stress via hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline, intentionally raising blood pressure to allow the limbs to move quicker, the brain to focus better, and to generally handle a stressful situation more effectively. Hypertension is a symptom of stress, whether chronic or acute.</p>

								<p>As established, another cause of high blood pressure is clogging of the arteries, which is itself a symptom of any disease that may result in plaque buildup, such as congenital heart disease (CHD). Diabetes is also known to have a strong correlation with hypertension. Hyperinsulinemia (abnormally high insulin levels), commonly associated with type 2 diabetes, can cause hypertension. Insulin resistance may also be a cause.<sup><a href="#14">[15]</a></sup></p>

								<p>Excess body fat, obesity, and a sedentary lifestyle also contribute to high blood pressure.<sup><a href="#15">[16,17]</a></sup> In men and women, 26% and 28% of high blood pressure cases can be attributed to excess fat tissue or obesity, respectively.<sup><a href="#17">[18]</a></sup> In many cases, high blood pressure may be treated simply by making lifestyle changes. This data further demonstrates that hypertension may not be a disease that causes symptoms itself, but conversely a symptom of other diseases and poor lifestyle habits. It is true that medication can help treat high blood pressure and perhaps even other conditions; however, it is far from the only, safest, or most effective method. Along with healthy dietary choices, regular exercise, and reducing stress, there are other effective methods to lower blood pressure, such as increasing potassium intake.</p>

								<div id="header-sect">
									<h2 id="potassium-prescription">The Potassium Prescription</h2>
									<h3 id="header-sect-subtext">How potassium can treat high blood pressure</h3>
									</div>

								<p>As discussed in previous sections, medications have several risks and should only be used if necessary. Fortunately, there are natural solutions to high blood pressure for those who need them. One of the most effective method for naturally lowering blood pressure is simply increasing potassium intake.</p>
									
								<p>A randomized cross-over trial examining elderly hypertensive patients found that long-term potassium supplementation (4 months / 48 mmol daily) was effective for lowering blood pressure in the subjects compared to placebo. In the first month of taking 60 mmol (~2,340 mg) daily, the subjects had a blood pressure of 160/89. Some of the subjects continued for 4 months of 48 mmol (~1,872 mg) daily and had their blood pressure drop down to 147/83, roughly a 7-8% decrease.<sup><a href="#18">[19]</a></sup></p>

								<p>Even individuals whose blood pressures fall within medical guidelines can benefit from increasing potassium intake. A national survey performed by the CDC from 2017 to 2018 concluded that the average potassium intake of the U.S. population older than 2 years is 2,496 mg, falling short of both the male and female Adequate Intake (AI) of 3,400 mg and 2,600 mg, respectively.<sup><a href="#19">[20]</a></sup></p>

								<p>The consequences of widespread potassium deficiency are broad. In a study published in 1997, researchers analyzed blood and urine specimens of 11,600 people to determine risk factors for coronary heart disease and mortality. The researchers concluded that there was “an unexpectedly powerful protective relation of dietary potassium to all cause mortality."<sup><a href="#20">[21]</a></sup></p>

								<p>With the significance of these improvements and protective effects, some may wonder how potassium, a mineral that is already in the food we consume, isn’t the first-line treatment for high blood pressure. Increasing potassium intake has few to no side effects, especially compared to blood pressure medication; even high doses have not shown negative effects in studies, with the exception of increasing potassium intake alongside drugs that artificially heighten blood potassium levels. Overall, high potassium doses over extended periods of time appear to be safer than traditional first-line treatment medication with comparable benefits.</p>

								<div id="header-sect">
									<h2 id="k-fix">How to Get Your K Fix</h2>
									<h3 id="header-sect-subtext">Excellent sources of potassium</h3>
									</div>

								<p>Potassium is one of the easiest nutrients to boost in your diet. Fruits, fruit juices, vegetables, and milk are among the best and easiest foods to implement. Bananas, potatoes, raisins, prunes, and coconut water contain high amounts of potassium. To consume an additional 1,900 mg of potassium daily, you could eat 4 large bananas, or 1 ¼ lbs potatoes, or a little over half a pound of raisins. Fruit juices, dairy, and vegetables are another option. 2 cups of orange juice net 886 mg of potassium, 2 cups of whole milk provide 644 mg, and one cup of chopped, fresh spinach packs 838 mg.</p>

									<h2 id="salts-fault">Is it Salt's Fault?</h2>
									<h3 id="header-sect-subtext">Why salt restriction isn't the solution</h3>

								<p>It is without question that there are many people, doctors included, who recommend restricting salt intake to treat high blood pressure. While salt restriction can indeed have a mild effect on blood pressure, its benefit is typically highly exaggerated and potentially dangerous.</p>
									
								<p>A 1998 meta-analysis on studies randomizing subjects with high and low-sodium diets concluded that for hypertensive individuals across 58 trials, reduced sodium intake lowered systolic blood pressure by an average of 3.9 mm Hg, and diastolic blood pressure by an average of 1.9 mm Hg. The mean consumption of sodium was 118 mmol—i.e., 2,700 mg—per 24 hours.<sup><a href="#21">[22]</a></sup> The same meta-analysis also examined 56 trials of reduced sodium intake on subjects with normal blood pressures. The mean reduced sodium intake was 160 mmol, i.e., 3,678 mg. This reduction lowered systolic pressure by 1.2 mm Hg and diastolic pressure by .26 mm Hg.</p>

								<p>For reference, the AHA currently recommends “no more than 2,300 mg a day and moving toward an ideal limit of no more than 1,500 mg per day for most adults,"<sup><a href="#22">[23]</a></sup> with such recommendations being aimed at reducing hypertension and cardiovascular disease. The “reduced sodium intake" for non-hypertensive subjects in the study was <em>2.45x more</em> than the “ideal limit" that the AHA recommends. In this meta-analysis, it did not significantly affect blood pressure; in fact, it reduced blood pressure by less than 10% of the amount that increasing potassium intake was demonstrated to reduce. The authors concluded: “These results do not support a general recommendation to reduce sodium intake. Reduced sodium intake may be used as a supplementary treatment in hypertension."</p>


								<p>Sodium is absolutely necessary for our bodies to function. Our bodies cannot synthesize it either, therefore it must be obtained from the diet. Despite the antagonistic view many hold against salt, higher sodium intake has been shown in studies to lower rates of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for congestive heart failure,<sup><a href="#23">[24]</a></sup> reduce cardiovascular disease mortality and all-cause mortality rates,<sup><a href="#24">[25,26]</a></sup> and improve potassium and magnesium retention.<sup><a href="#26">[27]</a></sup> Sodium also balances water and electrolytes, and it is a requirement for every cell to function properly.<sup><a href="#27">[28]</a></sup> It is necessary for numerous functions in the body, such as metabolic and nerve functions.</p>

									<h2 id="cant-shake-cravings">Why We Can't Shake Salt Cravings</h2>
									<h3 id="header-sect-subtext">Salt cravings are there for a reason</h3>
									</div>

								<p>It has been shown that during salt depletion, the human body craves salty foods.<sup><a href="#28">[29]</a></sup> Many animals have demonstrated the ability to pick their own diets for proper development and growth. Humans are no exception.</p>
									
								<p>An in-hospital experiment on three infants published in <i>American Journal of Diseases of Children</i> in 1928 suggests that human infants who have been recently weaned are able to successfully choose their own diets for proper development and growth. The infants may have experienced an instinctive desire for specific foods that contain the nutrients they must obtain to survive. The authors made an interesting statement on the infants' salt consumption: “Salt they ate only occasionally, often spluttering, choking or even crying bitterly after getting it in the mouth but never trying to spit it out and frequently going back for more, with a repetition of the same spluttering, etc."<sup><a href="#29">[30]</a></sup></p>
									
								<p>This raises the question: despite the fact that the children clearly did not like the taste, why did they keep going back for more? Either humans are the only species that are born masochists, or more reasonably, their body instinctively recognized they needed salt in their diets. Note that no salt was added to any of the foods given to the toddlers. Naturally, the infants didn’t eat salt too often, as pure salt gives the body more than enough sodium even in what would be relatively small quantities.</p>

								<p>It is simple to perform this experiment firsthand and return the same results. If one deliberately practices a very low-sodium diet, they will almost certainly find themself craving salt. Many people already practice a low-sodium diet for health reasons and succumb to this craving on a daily basis, but evidence coupled with logical reasoning provides a strong argument that salt restriction goes against human physiology.</p>

									<h3 id="header-sect-subtext">A word of caution before stopping medication</h3>
									</div>

								<p>If, after reading all of the compiled research above regarding high blood pressure, medication risks, and potential solutions, you decide to quit your current medication, caution is advised. While it is safe to increase potassium intake and avoid sodium restriction, if you believe your blood pressure is too high, it is best to consult your doctor before quitting a medication, as ceasing use of medication abruptly has serious health risks. Additionally, every individual is different and there may be underlying issues that a doctor knows about you to better cater to your needs.</p>

									<h2 id="turning-pressure-down">Turning the Pressure Down</h2>
									<h3 id="header-sect-subtext">Conclusion</h3>
									</div>

								<p>This article has touched on the history of dropping blood pressure guidelines, the truth that most people with clinical hypertension are <i>not</i> at risk, the commonly misdirected blame of hypertension as a disease rather than a symptom, the underlying causes of hypertension, the risks of hypertensive medication and how to treat high blood pressure safely and effectively with potassium, and why salt restriction as a treatment for high blood pressure should be avoided. Upon deconstructing dogma and examining the data, there is a strong case to be made against the current medical recommendations hypertensive treatment. We hope that this article has provided you with a new perspective and better solutions to improve your health.</p>
